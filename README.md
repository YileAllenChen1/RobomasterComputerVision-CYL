The RoboMaster program is a platform for robotic competitions and academic exchange founded by Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) and specially designed for global technology enthusiasts.

During the competition, robots from two teams battle each other on the arena by shooting pellets at armor plates mounted on the robots. The rules and format are somewhat similar to League of Lengends (LOL). Computer vision is widely used on the robots to track and detect opponent robots and perform autoaiming and shooting. There is also a power rune that robots have to target to earn energy buffs during the competition, which also requires computer vision.
